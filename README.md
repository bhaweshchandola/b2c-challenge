# b2c-coding challenge

The challenge solution has been divided into two parts
1. `main.py` reads the input file and iterate over each customer to check if it meets the given criteria.
2. `func.py` contains the functions needed for the solution. Like, conversion from degree to radians, calculating the distance between two coordinates and sorting the customer via user id.


### Requirements

All files i.e `main.py`, `func.py`, and `Customers _Assignment_Coding Challenge.txt` should be present in the same directory

### Running the code

Code is written in python 3.5

Simple run the main file via command `python3 main.py`

It reads the list of customers from the given file present in the directory and prints the list of customers within 100 km of given coordinates
